        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate shavings or cocoa nibs</li>
        <li>Fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Prepare the Coffee Soaking Liquid</h2>
        </li>

        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the cooled espresso, coffee liqueur, and vanilla extract. Stir well and set aside.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h2>Make the Mascarpone Filling</h2>
        </li>

        <ul>
            <li> In a heatproof bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water,
                ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and
                becomes pale.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Add the mascarpone cheese and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the
                mascarpone mixture until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Assemble the Tiramisu</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are moistened but not soggy. Arrange a layer
                of
                dipped ladyfingers at the bottom of a serving dish or individual glasses.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the ladyfingers, smoothing it out with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone filling.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Chill and Garnish</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the dish or glasses with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight,
                to
                allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder and garnish with dark chocolate shavings or
                cocoa
                nibs. Add a touch of elegance with fresh mint leaves.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Indulge and Enjoy!</h2>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve chilled and savor the divine layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and velvety mascarpone filling.
                Revel
                in the rich, heavenly flavors of this ethereal Tiramisu delight that will transport your taste buds to a
                realm of pure espresso euphoria.</li>
